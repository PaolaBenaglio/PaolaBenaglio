ðŸ˜€ Hi I am @PaolaBenaglio, I am a computational biologist and genomicist (yes a real word) with 8 years of post-doctorate experience at UCSD! 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything related to human genetics and genomics and Iâ€™m currently learning how to improve cancer immunotherapy with Shoreline!

ðŸ§¬I am developing a Next-Gen Sequecning and Bioinformatics platform and will post here tutorials and pipelines for all bioinformatics users and enthusiasts!
